TYPESCRIPT EDITIONS:
-------------------

TypeScript 0.8 -> October 2012
	TypeScript was first made public in October 2012 (at version 0.8), after two years of internal development at Microsoft.
TypeScript 0.9 -> 2013
	Added support for generics.
TypeScript 1.0 -> 2014
	TypeScript 1.0 was released at Microsoft's Build developer conference in 2014.
	(NOTE : Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 provides built-in support for TypeScript.)
-> 2014	
	In July 2014, the development team announced a new TypeScript compiler, claiming 5Ã— performance gains. 
	Simultaneously, the source code, which was initially hosted on CodePlex, was moved to GitHub.
TypeScript 2.0 -> September 2016
	It introduced several features, including the ability for programmers to optionally prevent variables from being assigned null values,[27] sometimes referred to as the billion-dollar mistake.
