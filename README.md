Sub: Resignation

Dear Mr.Sumit Rusia,

    I regretfully inform you that I will be resigning from the position of Angular Developer from ASM Enterprises Solutions Pvt Ltd.  Although working with JIO Enterprises  has been a pleasure, due to certain unavoidable personal reasons my presence is required elsewhere.I apologize for this decision to be abrupt and do hope that my leaving will not cause you or JIO Enterprises any inconvenience.

Although my employment contract states a required notice period of 3 months, I would like to reduce this to 2 weeks, completing my employment on 6 September, 2019.

This is due to certain unavoidable personal reasons and I hope we can come to an amicable agreement to grant this request. I will do everything possible to provide a smooth handover on my current projects.

I have enjoyed being a part of the team and am thankful for the opportunities you have given me during my time here. I hope that I can rely on you for a positive reference in future.

Persoanl email ID: sekharkumar.pyla@gmail.com,
Mobile number: 8106586514

Thanks & Regards
Sekhar P
